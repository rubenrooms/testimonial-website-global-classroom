								<h2>Victoria Rodriguez</h2>
								<p>When my wife was working at a tutoring center. Although the manager knew about me, my wife was forced to keep my existence hidden from the Children. My wife actually had to make up a fictional male fiance and later has been to account for the wedding rings to anyone who asked the business, claimed to be supportive of us but did not want to upset the parents.</p>

								<h2>Anonymous</h2>
								<p>In 1982, when I was 13 years old. I wanted to go to a comic book store in a section of Brooklyn called NRC at the time can RC was ethnic white working class. I got off at the bus stop and started walking to the comic book store. A car stopped and a man got out and yelled at me to get out of his neighborhood. I distinctly remember him telling me if I came to your neighborhood I would be jumped. As I walked away I turned back to look at him going into his car to get a stick or some kind of blunt instrument. I realized then that he wanted to make sure I never came back to his neighborhood again. He chased me down the street while running. I saw an elderly white woman and her black caretaker sitting outside. I ran towards them and the man turned around and walked away.</p>

								<h2>Kirby's story</h2>
								<p>I met someone in high school and we started dating. I fell pregnant three months before graduating and moved in with him. The first time he put his hands on me was why I was pregnant. I wanted my daughter to have a father, so I stayed with him. The violence progressed. It was sexual, physical and emotional abuse. No one knew what went on behind closed doors. He treated me like I was his property. I got my first restraining order after he showed up at my apartment, threw me around, choked me. I got another 14 years later, but I ended up dropping it because I didn't have anyone to represent me and I was afraid of his threats.</p>

								<h2>Tiffany's story</h2>
								<p>I met my abuser when I was 14. At first. There wasn't physical abuse, it was emotional. He would embarrass me or make feel inferior in front of other people. It went from verbal to physical real fast. When I was seven months pregnant, he made me until I was on the floor, curled in a bomb while I was in the hospital. Having my child, he cashed my mom's chicken, bought drugs to sell.</p>

								<h2>Anonymous</h2>
								<p>I heard from one of the workers at an Action Day primary plus preschool in California about a case of a teacher who spoke out loud that she doesn't like Asian kids and violently yelled many times targeting asian kids in her classroom. Most of the kids there cannot talk yet, so the parents did not know. However, the principle and most of teachers in the classrooms next door can hear clearly her anger with asian kids. Due to the COVID-19 situation and lack of staff, the principal and management from that action day primary plus location didn't take further action to prevent their staff and educate them about hate crime or giving advice, strict warnings or punishment. It's happening every day to those kids.</p>
